## Building a newsreader using the HackerNews Api, React, React Testing Library, Styled Components, Axios & Memo.

This application is a newsreader that calls the Hackernews Api. This project was built using React (create-react-app as a base) and the technologies used were React (Custom Hooks), Styled Components, Axios, Memo and React Testing Library. I'm hoping this application gives people a better understanding of React.
